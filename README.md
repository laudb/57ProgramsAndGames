These programs are from a real book, although an old one. My purpose is to re-write these programs in modern programming languages, doing my best to leverage techniques offered by programming language where needed.

Each folder is a program from the book, which introduces the challenge: depicts a formulae, an example, a flow chart and finally the solution in code. However these folders so far will include a Example, original code in BASIC and then its modern counterpart.

My aim is to get to the last chapter, my favourite.
