These programs are from a real book, although an old one. My purpose is to re-write these programs in modern programming languages. Reasons behind doing so are more of a sentimental kind, perhaps the story on this could go on that blog..

Each folder is a program from the book, which introduces the challenge, depicts a formulae, an example, a flow chart and finally the solution in code. However these folders so far will indlude a README, original code in BASIC and then its modern counterpart.

My aim is to get to the last chapter, my favourite.
